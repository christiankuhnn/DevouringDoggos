Since Dr. Bart's dogs need to selectively choose items that maximize their value while keeping their total weight equal to or below a threshold we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum value that can be attained using the first i items while limiting the weight to j. The solution can be obtained by filling up the array row by row using recurrence relations

The algorithm used to solve this problem is the Knapsack problem algorithm. It is a dynamic programming approach that stores the results of subproblems and reuses them to avoid redundant calculations, which leads to a time complexity of O(nW), where n is the number of items, and W is the maximum capacity. This time complexity is considered pseudo-polynomial since it depends on the size of the input values.
